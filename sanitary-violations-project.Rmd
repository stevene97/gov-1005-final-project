# Cleaning the "establishment names" column:
# A lot of the establishment names did not match perfectly in the dataset. For example, a restaurant like "Ihop" was coded as "I hop", "IHOP", and "I-Hop", leading to three distinct ways to describe only one restaurant. I first thought that the best way to fix this would be to create a unique identifier for this by first removing all spaces, dashes, and some other characters for the establishment names, and then combining the first three letters of this new variable with the address (note: addresses weren't as inconsistent as the establishment names). I figured that if the address and the first three letters matched they would be describing the same place.

# First step: creating a new column for a "unique ID" of each location
# Starting off by making all establishment names and addresses uppercase for sake of consistency. 
df <- df %>% 
  mutate(unique_id = toupper(establishment_name), address_address = toupper(address_address))

# Next step: removing all apostrophes, periods, dashes, and spaces for establishment names
df$unique_id = gsub("'", "", df$unique_id)
df$unique_id = gsub("â€™", "", df$unique_id)
df$unique_id = gsub("/.", "", df$unique_id)
df$unique_id = gsub(" ", "", df$unique_id)
df$unique_id = gsub("-", "", df$unique_id)

# Creating our 'unique_id': a combination of the address listed and the first three letters of the restaurant
df <- df %>% 
  mutate(unique_id = paste(address_address, substr(unique_id, 1, 3)))

# Continuing the matching process: creating a new data frame to create a list of "accurate" establishment names
df_ <- df

# Make the "accurate" establishment name equivalent to the first instance of that name
df_ <- df_ %>% 
  group_by(unique_id) %>% 
  summarize(first_estab = establishment_name[1])

# Join the datasets together in order to have the unique ID and the "first_estab" column, which creates the "accurate" names column I was hoping for
joined <- left_join(df_, df2, 'unique_id') %>% as.data.frame()

# My goal is to restrict the dataset to establishments I've made my own list for around Harvard Square. This could be done by filtering for latitudes/longitudes within a specific area around Harvard Square. This reduces the number of observations from about 30,000 to about 4,000, making it much easier for me to inspect and clean as I go along.
