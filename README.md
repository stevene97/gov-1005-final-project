# Gov 1005 Final Project
This final project looks at sanitary code violations for restaurants in Cambridge. The goal of this final project was to make an attempt to use data to try and settle some endless debates about food establishments in Harvard Square. For example, there's always a debate about Felipe’s versus Jefe’s, or BonChon versus the Kong, or the Starbucks in the Garage versus the Starbucks on Harvard Square. I’m hoping that this project could shed some light on how these establishments are reviewed by the city’s sanitary officials. Maybe this way, we could come up with a data-driven way to solve some of these debates.

# Sanitary Inspections in Cambridge
The data comes from the City of Cambridge's open data portal (link: https://data.cambridgema.gov/Inspectional-Services/Sanitary-Violations-105-CMR-590-000-/mh73-gjid). It is updated frequently (almost every day) and is a compilation of the sanitary violations cited by an inspector that is hired by the city to go out and check a food establishment's sanitation practices.
